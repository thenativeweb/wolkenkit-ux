# wolkenkit UX

wolkenkit-ux provides UI components for wolkenkit applications.


## Installation

```shell
$ npm install git+ssh://git@github.com:thenativeweb/wolkenkit-ux.git
```

## Using components

In order to use components in your React applications import them into your project

```js
import { Brand } from 'wolkenkit-ux';
```

## Running the styleguide

While developing the client you want to get feedback as quick as possible if the client still runs in current browsers. Therefore you can run the following command.

```bash
$ bot styleguide
```

This will start a wolkenkit UX styleguide. Point your browser to http://localhost:6060.
